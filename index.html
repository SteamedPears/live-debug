        <h1>Abstract Unit Testing Simulator</h1>
        <p>
            Your co-worker has implemented a math parser, but doesn't think he needs to test it. You, of course, know that code <i>must always</i> be unit-tested! Otherwise, when someone goes to "improve" it, they might not notice when they break something.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parser can perform +,-,/, and *, and supports paranthesis. It's easy enough to feed garbage input to the system, and all bets are off if you do. You're only interested in ensuring that valid inputs get back valid results. However, it should handle something like 1.5+3/2*(9-2*8/(-2)+9)-2*6/1 without a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Write a series of expressions -- one per line -- of the form [expression] = [value], such as
            <div class="well">
                1.5+3/2*(9-2*8/(-2)+9)-2*6/1 = 28.5    
            </div>
            to test against the parser. Initially, the parser should work exactly as expected. Hitting the "Improve" button will cause something to break, though! Try to write a series of equations that will allow you to notice when something has broken, and identitify what has broken. Try to be as precise as possible, so your co-workers can spend less time trying to figure out what's wrong.
        </p>
        <div class="left-align">
            <form id="input">
                <textarea name="input" id="input-field">
This is a good unit test:
1+1 = 2

This is a good integration test, but not a very helpful unit test:
1.5+3/2*(9-2*8/(-2)+9)-2*6/1 = 28.5
                 </textarea><br>
                <button type="submit">Test</button>
                <button id="randomize">"Improve"</button>
            </form>
        </div>
        <div class="right-align">
            <div id="output">
            
            </div>
